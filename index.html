                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Aaron, a 17-year-old aspiring game developer from Germany. <br> I've been developing games since I was 7 years old — sort of. Through game development, I've come into contact with many areas of art: programming, 3D modeling, texturing, level design, game design, sound design, and music composition. <br> I've been exploring all these areas as much as my time allows, and due to my curiosity about all these topics, I've become somewhat of a generalist. <i>This means I know enough about most things to do them, but not enough to do them professionally.</i> <br> Still, I haven't been sitting around! So, please enjoy a few select projects that I've been a part of—or made myself—below. <br> <b>Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web, have fun!</b></p>

                        <p class="album-description">Into the Dungeon is a collection of music that I originally improvised for a D&D campaign. I have taken these initial improvisations and re-written them to be a bit more sophisticated. <br> You'll find everything here: Character Themes, Exploration Music, Battle Music, and much more. <br> <b>ENJOY!</b></p>

                        <p class="album-description">Color Convert came to be out of the need to constantly convert RGB colours in a 0-255 scale to a 0-1 float scale for IMGUI. That's why I decided to write this quick web-gui to make exactly that conversion easier. Sure... I could have built the functionality in code, but this seemed like the better option at the time. <br> Oh well...</p>
