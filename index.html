                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Aaron - A 17 Year old aspiring Game-Developer from Germany. <br> I have been developing games since I was 7 years old - well, I've been trying to at least. <br> Through game-development I've come into contact with many areas of art: Programming, 3d-Modelling, Texturing, Level-Design, Game-Design, Sound-Design, and Music-Composition. <br> I've been exploring all these areas as much as my time allows and due to my curiosity about all of these topics I've become somewhat of a generalist (which is just a fancy way of saying that I know enough about most things to <b>do</b> them, but not enough about them to do them <b>professionally</b>). Still, I have not been sitting around, so please enjoy a couple of select projects that I've been apart of - or I've made myself - below. <br> <b>Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web, have fun!</b></p>

                        <p class="album-description">Into the Dungeon is a collection of music that I originally improvised for a D&D campaign. I have taken these initial improvisations and re-written them to be a bit more sophisticated. <br> You'll find everything here: Character Themes, Exploration Music, Battle Music, and much more. <br> <b>ENJOY!</b></p>
